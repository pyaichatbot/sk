## 🔧 Implementation Guidelines

### **Development Approach:**
1. **Incremental Implementation**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
2. **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests before implementing features
3. **Documentation First**: Document architecture decisions and APIs
4. **Security by Design**: Implement security controls from the beginning
5. **Configuration-Driven Observability**: All optional observability features must be configurable via environment variables

### **Quality Gates:**
- **Code Review**: All code must be reviewed before merging
- **Automated Testing**: All tests must pass before deployment
- **Performance Testing**: Load testing required for each service
- **Security Scanning**: Security vulnerabilities must be addressed

### **Deployment Strategy:**
- **Blue-Green Deployment**: Zero-downtime deployments
- **Feature Flags**: Gradual feature rollouts
- **Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring during deployments
- **Rollback Plan**: Quick rollback capability for failed deployments

### **Observability Configuration:**
- **MANDATORY Features**: Must be always enabled and working
- **OPTIONAL Features**: Can be enabled/disabled via configuration flags
- **Local Development**: All optional features should be disableable for local Docker testing
- **Production**: Optional features should be easily configurable via Kubernetes ConfigMaps/Secrets

## 📝 Notes

- **Critical Priority**: Intermediate Message Handling ✅ **COMPLETED** - Real-time agent call visibility now operational
- **Optional Features**: All other observability features are configurable and can be disabled for local development
- **Dependencies**: Many tasks have dependencies that must be completed in order
- **Resource Allocation**: High-priority and critical tasks should receive most development resources
- **Risk Mitigation**: Address security and performance concerns early in each phase
- **Production Ready**: Core microservices architecture is now production-ready with enterprise-grade features
